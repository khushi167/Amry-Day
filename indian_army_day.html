        <h2> A Tribute To our Army Officers</h2>

        <p><b>75th Army Day 2023:</b>  The Indian Army was officially established on 1 April 1895. India got its first Army Chief in 1949. On 15 January 1949, Field Marshal K. M. Cariappa took over the first Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army from General Francis Butcher, the last British Commander-in-Chief of India. This year, India is celebrating its 75th Army Day on 15 January. <br> <b>Why is Army Day Celebrated in India?</b> <br>

India attained independence on August 15, 1947, after slavery under British rule for almost 200 years. At the time of Indian independence, the country was experiencing communal riots refugees were coming from Pakistan and some people were migrating toward Pakistan.

 

Due to this type of anarchic atmosphere, many administrative problems started arising when the army had to come forward to control the situation so that peace can be ensured during the partition.

 

At the time of Indian independence, the command of the Indian army was in the hands of British General Sir Francis Butcher. So this was the right time to hand over full control of the country in the hands of the Indians; hence Field Marshal K. M.  Cariappa became the first Indian Army Chief of Independent India on 15 January 1949.</p>
